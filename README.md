## Appartners


#### About The Project:

The Appartners app is an effective and simple tool for finding roommates and looking for roommates.
There are 2 types of users: looking for an apartment and looking for a partner.
Each user will be redirected to a different route where they will have to fill in details that suit them as well as the relevant search page.

#### Our goal:

Create a comfortable and efficient environment that will create the best fit.
When you are looking for partners for the apartment you live in, you can choose them according to their level of suitability for the type of apartment and the partners who are in it, depending on what the candidates said about themselves in the app.

#### Features:
* Publish apartment which includes:
  - number of rooms, number of occupants, type of available room, address and rent
* Offer myself as a partner which includes:
  - name, age, city, selfie photo and short description
* Search for an apartment by city and max price
* Login
* Sign Up
* Upload images from Gallery or Camera Shot
* Images view by horizontal swipe
